    Quokka Maze
    -----------

    This class is the undirected graph class that will contain all the
    information about the locations between the Quokka colony's current home
    and their final destination.

    We _will_ be performing some minor adversarial testing this time, so make
    sure you're performing checks and ensuring that the graph is a valid simple
    graph!

    ===== Func tions =====

        * block_edge(u, v) - removes the edge between vertex `u` and vertex `v`
        * fix_edge(u, v) - fixes the edge between vertex `u` and `v`. or adds an
            edge if non-existent
        * find_path(s, t, k) - find a SIMPLE path from veretx `s` to vertex `t`
            such that from any location with food along this simple path we
            reach the next location with food in at most `k` steps
        * exists_path_with_extra_food(s, t, k, x) - returns whether itâ€™s
            possible for the quokkas to make it from s to t along a simple path
            where from any location with food we reach the next location with
            food in at most k steps, by placing food at at most x new locations

    ===== Notes ======

    * We _will_ be adversarially testing, so make sure you check your params!
    * The ordering of vertices in the `vertex.edges` does not matter.
    * You MUST check that `k>=0` and `x>=0` for the respective functions
        * find_path (k must be greater than or equal to 0)
        * exists_path_with_extra_food (k and x must be greater than or equal to
            0)
    * This is an undirected graph, so you don't need to worry about the
        direction of traversing during your path finding.
    * This is a SIMPLE GRAPH, your functions should ensure that it stays that
        way.
    * All vertices in the graph SHOULD BE UNIQUE! IT SHOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE
        TO ADD DUPLICATE VERTICES! (i.e the same vertex instance)
